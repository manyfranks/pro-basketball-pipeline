Featured Betting Markets
These are the most common markets that are featured by bookmakers. Terminology for betting markets can vary by country, sport and even amongst bookmakers. We aim to simplify this by defining the following markets

Market Key
(use in the API)	Market Names	Description
h2h	Head to head, Moneyline	Bet on the winning team or player of a game (includes the draw for soccer)
spreads	Points spread, Handicap	The spreads market as featured by a bookmaker. Bet on the winning team after a points handicap has been applied to each team
totals	Total points/goals, Over/Under	The totals market as featured by a bookmaker. Bet on the total score of the game being above or below a threshold
outrights	Outrights, Futures	Bet on a final outcome of a tournament or competition
h2h_lay	Same as h2h	Bet against a h2h outcome. This market is only applicable to betting exchanges
outrights_lay	Same as outrights	Bet against an outrights outcome. This market is only applicable to betting exchanges

spreads and totals markets are mainly available for US sports and bookmakers at this time.

For descriptions of these markets, see examples of betting markets.

#Additional Markets
Starting in 2023, more markets are becoming available in the API. Additional markets are currently limited to US sports and selected bookmakers, however coverage is expanding. Additional markets update at 1 minute intervals.

Due to the growing size of the API response, additional markets need to be accessed one event at a time using the new /events/{eventId}/odds endpoint.
